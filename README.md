In this folder you can find an R package to implement the conformal prediction under truncation
in the paper: "Robust Survival Prediction with Conformal Methods for Left-truncated and Right-censored Data".

To use the proposed method in the paper, please install the R package in this folder "ConformalPredictionUnderTruncation_0.1.0.tar.gz" via running in R or RStudio: install.packages("Directory_of_the_Package/ConformalPredictionUnderTruncation_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

The main function named "predInterval" will generate the upper bounds and the lower bounds of two-sided conformal prediction intervals.
